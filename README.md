## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
This is the config of my main private machine at home. It is a framework using the CoolerMaster case.
The main goal is to have a clean and easy to use setup to host all my services and applications.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

This will create a Hetzner Cloud server and start to build the nixos configuration on it.

```bash
test/start.sh
```

### Stopping

This will stop the Hetzner Cloud server and remove it. This is advised to save costs.

```bash
test/remove.sh
```


### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
